# Notebooks Directory

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for exploratory data analysis, experiments, and demonstrations.

## Naming Convention

Use a numbered prefix to indicate the order and category:
- `01_exploration_*.ipynb` - Initial data exploration
- `02_preprocessing_*.ipynb` - Data cleaning and preprocessing
- `03_modeling_*.ipynb` - Model development and training
- `04_evaluation_*.ipynb` - Model evaluation and comparison
- `05_visualization_*.ipynb` - Creating visualizations and reports

Example: `01_exploration_customer_analysis.ipynb`

## Guidelines

1. Clear markdown cells explaining the purpose and findings
2. Run all cells before committing to ensure reproducibility
3. Clear output cells for large datasets to reduce file size
4. Use descriptive names that indicate the notebook's purpose
5. Keep notebooks focused on a single analysis or task
