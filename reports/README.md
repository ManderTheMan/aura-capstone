# Reports Directory

This directory contains generated analysis reports, presentations, and documentation.

## Organization

- **figures/**: Charts, graphs, and visualizations (PNG, PDF, SVG)

## Naming Convention

`{YYYY-MM-DD}_{report_type}_{description}.{ext}`

## Guidelines

1. Use dates in filenames for versioning
2. Export plots at high resolution (300 DPI for print)
3. Keep figures separate from reports for reusability
4. Document methodology and findings clearly
5. Include source code or notebook references
6. Version control reports that don't contain sensitive data
